\chapter{Using modeling to enhance just outcomes}

% This chapter addresses my proposal to ``validate'' \ac{osier} by conducting a
% case study of energy planning processes in Champaign-Urbana through interviews
% with decision makers and planners about energy justice, energy modeling, and
% energy planning. As well as introduce interviewees to \ac{osier} itself and
% solicit feedback from them about its potential usefulness and what obstacles may
% interfere with its adoption. 

% Although I originally set out to conduct a limited case study of Chambana, I
% discovered that municipalities in Illinois do not, in general, have the decision
% making authority to make specific choices about their energy supply.
% Thus, I expanded my study to the state level; interviewing people from the
% \ac{ipa} and \ac{icc}. This expanded scope provided evidence for structural
% challenges blocking municipal influence from energy planning processes. Further,
% this evinces a tension among distributive, procedural, and recognition justice.

% \section{Progress on developing tools for local use}

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The literature review chapter indicated that most energy modeling tools
%     and much of the related literature focus on state- or national-scale energy
%     systems.
%     \item The the hyper-local section highlighted some studies that integrated
%     local perspectives with energy modeling. Those papers include 
%     \cite{mckenna_combining_2018, johannsen_municipal_2023, fleischhacker_portfolio_2019}
%     \item There have also been studies investigating the development of models for, and
%     use by, city and urban planners.
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Municipal Levers: How municipalities make choices about their energy supply}
% There are generally four ways municipalities can make choices about their energy supply.

% \subsection{\ac{mca}}
% This is where municipalities participate in electricity markets on behalf of
% their residents. Although this allows municipalities to choose an energy supply
% besides the standard portfolio provided by an electric utility, municipalities
% do not have full control over their energy supply. Instead, municipalities
% negotiate for a few portfolios through a bidding process. While they can specify
% some criteria, such as a percentage of renewable energy, the specific generation
% mix depends on the company that developed the portfolio bid. Further, residents
% are still allowed to opt-out of \ac{mca} and elect the standard portfolio
% provided by their electric utility.

% \subsection{Utility ownership}
% Some municipalities in Illinois, such as Naperville, own their own distribution
% system. This gives a municipality greater control over the design of their
% utility system and allows a municipality to make decisions about the tradeoff
% between cost and resiliency. For example, Naperville undergounded most of the
% electric distribution system and new distribution is automatically undergounded.
% However, this model does not award control of electric supply to the
% municipality, which must procure electricity through another entity such as the
% \acf{imea}.

% \subsection{Municipal-owned generation}
% In very few cases, a municipality may own some of its own generation. \ac{uiuc}
% owns a coal and natural gas plant, a solar array, chilled water storage, and
% participates in a \ac{ppa} to purchase wind power. More commonly, municipalities
% will lease land cheaply to a solar company, for example, and purchase some or all
% of the rights to that electricity through a \ac{ppa}.
