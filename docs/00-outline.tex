\textcolor{red}{To section ``2.4.2 Accounting for Uncertainty'' I want to add 
a paragraph describing a third type of uncertainty: Normative uncertainty 
\cite{taebi_governing_2020}. I might want to allude to this type of uncertainty
earlier when I talk about the ``technical solutions'' to climate change (and why
there are so many potential solutions, but little agreement). This will support
the following chapter/section about the conceptual framework of modeling. ``How
can modelers change to accommodate this new understanding of decision making?''}

\chapter{\acf{osier}}
\label{chapter:osier}

This chapter introduces \acf{osier}, a novel open-source energy system modeling
framework for \acl{moo} \cite{dotson_osier_nodate}. There are currently no
\acp{esom} that enable \ac{moo} and \ac{osier} fills that gap. Figure 
\ref{fig:osier_flow} illustrates the flow of data into and within \ac{osier}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/osier_flow}
    \caption{The flow of data into and within \ac{osier}}
    \label{fig:osier_flow}
\end{figure}

Technology data, objectives, constraints, and a dispatch model are all features
within \ac{osier}, while \ac{pymoo} drives the optimization of these objectives.
The dispatch model is independently executable for inspecting specific test
cases and mapping solutions from other solvers onto \ac{osier}'s objective
space. The next section elaborates on the dispatch model's formulation.

\textcolor{red}{This chapter is mostly written but there are a few things that
should be added.}

\textcolor{red}{\begin{enumerate}
    \item Update to the \ac{mga} algorithm.
    \item Add description of the ``greedy'' farthest-first traversal algorithm.
    \item Move the description of \ac{pygen} and \ac{temoa} to either a
    different section or a different chapter since those pieces do not belong to
    \ac{osier} itself.
    \item Add a description of the ``simplified approach'' to capacity expansion
    that will be added to the model and used the example chapter.
    \item Remove the description of model data.
    \item Add a description of the hypothetical \ac{osier} procedure, as
    proposed in the prelim.
\end{enumerate}}

\section{Inputs}

\textcolor{red}{General thoughts:}

Accurate input data is essential but represents a challenging step in the
modeling process. \ac{osier} attempts to lower this barrier by providing a
variety of technology data from ``reliable'' sources.

This section connects to the normative and descriptive portions of modeling.

\section{\acf{mga}}
This section talks about handling ``structural uncertainty'' with \ac{osier}.

\textcolor{red}{
\section{Limitations of \ac{osier}}

This section describes some of the limitations in \ac{osier}'s modeling details
and scope. For example, \ac{osier} does not model interactions between the
environment and the energy system. It also does not include a way to model the
effect of carbon emissions and/or any kind of climate forcing from heat-trapping
emissions nor any kind of geoengineering measures.

This responds to some of Cliff's comments on \ac{osier}.

\label{chapter:benchmark-results}

\textcolor{red}{This chapter will remain largely unchanged except for maybe one
additional example, demonstrating a different dispatch model that is much faster
but less robust. This new dispatch model will be used in the following chapter
where I investigate further examples including a hypothetical ``data center''
and an improvement on the \acf{set} \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}.}

\chapter{Using modeling to enhance just outcomes}

This chapter addresses my proposal to ``validate'' \ac{osier} by conducting a
case study of energy planning processes in Champaign-Urbana through interviews
with decision makers and planners about energy justice, energy modeling, and
energy planning. As well as introduce interviewees to \ac{osier} itself and
solicit feedback from them about its potential usefulness and what obstacles may
interfere with its adoption. 

Although I originally set out to conduct a limited case study of Chambana, I
discovered that municipalities in Illinois do not, in general, have the decision
making authority to make specific choices about their energy supply.
Thus, I expanded my study to the state level; interviewing people from the
\ac{ipa} and \ac{icc}. This expanded scope provided evidence for structural
challenges blocking municipal influence from energy planning processes. Further,
this evinces a tension among distributive, procedural, and recognition justice.

\section{Municipal Levers: How municipalities make choices about their energy supply}
There are generally four ways municipalities can make choices about their energy supply.

\subsection{\ac{mca}}
This is where municipalities participate in electricity markets on behalf of
their residents. Although this allows municipalities to choose an energy supply
besides the standard portfolio provided by an electric utility, municipalities
do not have full control over their energy supply. Instead, municipalities
negotiate for a few portfolios through a bidding process. While they can specify
some criteria, such as a percentage of renewable energy, the specific generation
mix depends on the company that developed the portfolio bid. Further, residents
are still allowed to opt-out of \ac{mca} and elect the standard portfolio
provided by their electric utility.

\subsection{Utility ownership}
Some municipalities in Illinois, such as Naperville, own their own distribution
system. This gives a municipality greater control over the design of their
utility system and allows a municipality to make decisions about the tradeoff
between cost and resiliency. For example, Naperville undergounded most of the
electric distribution system and new distribution is automatically undergounded.
However, this model does not award control of electric supply to the
municipality, which must procure electricity through another entity such as the
\acf{imea}.

\subsection{Municipal-owned generation}
In very few cases, a municipality may own some of its own generation. \ac{uiuc}
owns a coal and natural gas plant, a solar array, chilled water storage, and
participates in a \ac{ppa} to purchase wind power. More commonly, municipalities
will lease land cheaply to a solar company, for example, and purchase some or all
of the rights to that electricity through a \ac{ppa}.
