\chapter{Using modeling to enhance just outcomes}
\iffalse


This chapter addresses my proposal to ``validate'' \ac{osier} by conducting a
case study of energy planning processes in Champaign-Urbana through interviews
with decision makers and planners about energy justice, energy modeling, and
energy planning. As well as introduce interviewees to \ac{osier} itself and
solicit feedback from them about its potential usefulness and what obstacles may
interfere with its adoption. 

Although I originally set out to conduct a limited case study of Chambana, I
discovered that municipalities in Illinois do not, in general, have the decision
making authority to make specific choices about their energy supply.
Thus, I expanded my study to the state level; interviewing people from the
\ac{ipa} and \ac{icc}. This expanded scope provided evidence for structural
challenges blocking municipal influence from energy planning processes. Further,
this evinces a tension among distributive, procedural, and recognition justice.

\section{Municipal Levers: How municipalities make choices about their energy supply}
There are generally four ways municipalities can make choices about their energy supply.

\subsection{\ac{mca}}
This is where municipalities participate in electricity markets on behalf of
their residents. Although this allows municipalities to choose an energy supply
besides the standard portfolio provided by an electric utility, municipalities
do not have full control over their energy supply. Instead, municipalities
negotiate for a few portfolios through a bidding process. While they can specify
some criteria, such as a percentage of renewable energy, the specific generation
mix depends on the company that developed the portfolio bid. Further, residents
are still allowed to opt-out of \ac{mca} and elect the standard portfolio
provided by their electric utility.

\subsection{Utility ownership}
Some municipalities in Illinois, such as Naperville, own their own distribution
system. This gives a municipality greater control over the design of their
utility system and allows a municipality to make decisions about the tradeoff
between cost and resiliency. For example, Naperville undergounded most of the
electric distribution system and new distribution is automatically undergounded.
However, this model does not award control of electric supply to the
municipality, which must procure electricity through another entity such as the
\acf{imea}.

\subsection{Municipal-owned generation}
In very few cases, a municipality may own some of its own generation. \ac{uiuc}
owns a coal and natural gas plant, a solar array, chilled water storage, and
participates in a \ac{ppa} to purchase wind power. More commonly, municipalities
will lease land cheaply to a solar company, for example, and purchase some or all
of the rights to that electricity through a \ac{ppa}.
