\subsection{Exercise 1: Deciding Among Evolutionary Algorithms}

\ac{osier} allows users to choose among a variety of \ac{moo} methods. This is
motivated by the desire for flexibility. However, Exercises 1 and 2 use just one
algorithm, \ac{unsga3} as implemented by \ac{pymoo}, which should be justified
by comparing the results against different algorithms. As an important aside,
although I used the \ac{deap} implementations of \ac{nsga2} and \ac{nsga3},
these algorithms are not exclusive to \ac{deap}. \ac{pymoo} also implements
them, I simply wanted to show the breadth of support for different tools in
\ac{osier}. Figure \ref{fig:algorithm-comparison} provides the justification for
choosing \ac{unsga3} by comparing the results of three \ac{moo} algorithms by
showing the respective scatter plots and a density plot of the points on each
axis. Since it took \ac{unsga3} 128 generations to reach its convergence
criterion, the other two algorithms were also stopped after 128 generations,
before converging. The density plot above the scatter plot shows the density of
points along the ``total cost'' objective. Similarly, the density plot to the
right shows the distribution of points for the ``emissions'' objective.

There are a few notable features of Figure \ref{fig:algorithm-comparison}.
First, all three algorithms identified very similar Pareto fronts, the main
differences involve the distribution of points and the extent of their
respective solution sets. Second, the two \ac{deap} algorithms have a greater
number of points along the bottom part of the Pareto front, indicating a greater
sampling over the cost objective. This is further supported by the higher
concentration of points along the lower half of the emission objective's range.
Third, the algorithms implemented by \ac{deap} both have more extreme values
along both axes. All of these features can be attributed to the fact that
neither \ac{nsga2} nor \ac{nsga3} fully converged. Thus, choosing \ac{unsga3}
will be used for the remaining exercises for its faster convergence.
