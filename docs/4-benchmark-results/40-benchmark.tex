\ac{osier} is a key tool that will be leveraged in the analysis of subsequent
work. Accordingly, it must be shown that \ac{osier} generates reproducible and
reliable, results consistent with the results from an established framework.
This chapter has three objectives, the first is to illustrate some of the
differences between the two dispatch algorithms introduced in Section
\ref{section:dispatch_model}. The logical and optimal dispatch algorithms will
be tested on some simple cases. Then the time scaling of the two algorithms will
be compared. The second goal of this chapter, is to show that solutions
calculated by \ac{osier} agree with a more established \ac{esom}, \ac{temoa}.
Finally, this chapter demonstrates some of \ac{osier}'s advanced features, such
as many-objective objective problems and combining \ac{moo} with \ac{mga}.
The next section introduce some of the data and methods used to prepare the 
example problems that follow.

\section{Comparing dispatch algorithms}
The first exercise in this section directly compares the results of two dispatch algorithms
introduced in Section \ref{section:dispatch_model} to confirm that the two algorithms
give similar answers. The next exercise shows how the two algorithms scale. The final exercise
focuses on the logical dispatch algorithm and investigates how that algorithm scales with the
number of threads used for parallelization.
