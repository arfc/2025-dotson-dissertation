\chapter{Benchmark Results}
\label{chapter:benchmark-results}

\textcolor{red}{This chapter will remain largely unchanged except for maybe one
additional example, demonstrating a different dispatch model that is much faster
but less robust. This new dispatch model will be used in the following chapter
where I investigate further examples including a hypothetical ``data center''
and an improvement on the \acf{set} \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}.}

\ac{osier} is a key tool that will be leveraged in the analysis of subsequent
work. Accordingly, it must be shown that \ac{osier} generates reproducible and
reliable, results consistent with the results from an established framework.
This chapter has three objectives, the first is to illustrate some of the
differences among three evolutionary algorithms: \ac{nsga2}, \ac{nsga3}, and
\ac{unsga3}. Second, it shows that solutions calculated by \ac{osier} agree with
a more established \ac{esom}, \ac{temoa}. Lastly, it demonstrates some of
\ac{osier}'s advanced features, such as many-objective objective problems and
combining \ac{moo} with \ac{mga}.
