Due to its novelty, it is necessary to demonstrate that \ac{osier} 
generates reproducible and reliable answers consistent with the results 
from an established framework and that \ac{osier} is internally consistent
across when applying different methods.
To that end, this chapter illustrates some of the
differences between the two dispatch algorithms introduced in Section
\ref{section:dispatch_model} by testing the logical and optimal dispatch algorithms  
on some simple cases, as well as comparing the time scaling of these two methods. 
Second, this chapter verifies that solutions
calculated by \ac{osier} agree with a more established \ac{esom}, \ac{temoa}.
Finally, this chapter shows some of \ac{osier}'s advanced features, such
as many-objective objective problems and combining \ac{moo} with \ac{mga}.
The next section introduces some of the data and methods used to prepare the 
later example problems.

\section{Comparing dispatch algorithms}
The first exercise in this section directly compares the results of two dispatch algorithms
introduced in Section \ref{section:dispatch_model} to confirm that the two algorithms
give similar answers. The next exercise shows how the two algorithms scale. The final exercise
focuses on the logical dispatch algorithm and investigates how that algorithm scales with the
number of threads used for parallelization.
