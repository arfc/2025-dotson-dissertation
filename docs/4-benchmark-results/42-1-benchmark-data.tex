\subsection{\acs{temoa} and \acs{pygen}}
\label{section:temoa}

This thesis uses the tools \ac{temoa} and \ac{pygen} to establish benchmark
results for a typical \ac{esom}. \ac{temoa} is an open-source \ac{esom}
developed at North Carolina State University that uses \ac{milp} to develop
capacity-expansion scenarios \cite{decarolis_temoa_2010}. The key benefits of
\ac{temoa} are its open-source code, open data, and built-in uncertainty
analysis capabilities. These features address the need for greater transparency
in \ac{esom} modeling and robust assessment of future uncertainties
\cite{hunter_modeling_2013, fattahi_systemic_2020}. \ac{pygen} is another
open-source code, developed by this thesis' author, that facilitates rapid
development of \ac{temoa} models and enables sensitivity analyses using a
templated approach \cite{dotson_influence_2022, dotson_python_2021}. These
features of \ac{pygen} reduce the learning curve and the cost of producing
unique models in \ac{temoa} \cite{dotson_influence_2022}.

A single \ac{temoa} run minimizes total system cost \cite{decarolis_temoa_2010},

\begin{align}
  C_{total} &= C_{loans} + C_{fixed} + C_{variable}
  \intertext{where}
  C_{loans} &= \text{the sum of all investment loan costs},\nonumber\\
  C_{fixed} &= \text{the sum of all fixed operating costs},\nonumber\\
  C_{variable} &= \text{the sum of all variable operating costs}.\nonumber
\end{align}

Each of these terms is amortized over the model time horizon. The decision
variables include the generation from each technology at time, $t$, and the
capacity of each technology in year, $y$. The dispatch model deviates slightly
from the model described in Section \ref{section:dispatch} by making the initial
storage level for energy storage technologies a decision variable, whereas the
dispatch model used in this thesis does not optimize initial storage and assumes
energy storage starts at zero. The detailed formulation of \ac{temoa}'s
constraints and equations are available online \cite{decarolis_temoa_2010}.

\subsection{\acl{mga}}
\label{section:mga}
\ac{temoa}'s built-in method for uncertainty analysis is the \ac{hsj}
formulation of \ac{mga}. This algorithm is designed to handle
\textit{structural} uncertainty, which presumes to account for unmodeled
objectives. The steps for \ac{hsj} are \cite{decarolis_using_2011,
dotson_influence_2022}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item obtain an optimal solution by any method,
  \item add a user-specified amount of slack to the objective function value
  from the first step,
  \item use the adjusted objective function value as an upper bound constraint,
  \item generate a new objective function that minimizes the sum of all decision
  variables,
  \item iterate the procedure,
  \item stop the \ac{mga} when no significant changes are observed.
\end{enumerate}
The mathematical formulation of this algorithm is to
\begin{align}
  \intertext{minimize:}
  p &= \sum_{k\in K} x_k,
  \intertext{subject to:}
  f_j\left(\vec{x}\right) &\leq T_j \quad\forall \quad j,\\
  \vec{x}&\in X,
  \intertext{where}
  p &= \text{the new objective function}\nonumber,\\
  x_k &= \text{the $k^{th}$ decision variable with a nonzero value in previous solutions}\nonumber,\\
  f_j\left(\vec{x}\right) &= \text{the $j^{th}$ original objective function},\nonumber\\
  T_j &= \text{the slack-adjusted target value},\nonumber\\
  X &= \text{the set of all feasible solutions}.\nonumber
\end{align}

Figure \ref{fig:standard_mga} illustrates this algorithm for a simple \ac{lp}
with two decision variables and a slack value of 10\%.

\begin{align}
  \intertext{Minimize:}
  f(x_1, x_2) &= c_1x_1 + c_2x_2,
  \intertext{subject to:}
  x_1 &+ x_2 = 1,
  \intertext{where}
  x_{k} &= \text{the $k^{th}$ decision variable,} \nonumber \\
  c_{k} &= \text{the $k^{th}$ cost.}\nonumber
\end{align}

The optimal solution occurs where the objective and constraint functions
intersect at $\left(1,0\right)$. Relaxing the objective function by 10\% gives a
new constraint shown by the dashed line. Since the constraint is written as an
equality, the feasible space is given by all points on the constraint curve. The
new \ac{mga} solution is now at the intersection between the \ac{mga} constraint and the
original constraint, $\left(0.6, 0.4\right)$.

  \label{fig:standard_mga}
\end{figure}

This procedure results in a small set of maximally different solutions for
modelers to interpret. In this way, \ac{mga} efficiently proposes alternatives
that may capture unmodeled objectives, such as political expediency or social
acceptance. However, this method depends on a single objective function which
does not guarantee that these alternative solutions will be optimal or
near-optimal for any other measurable objective.


\ac{pygen} was an initial exploration on repeatable analysis and functionality
extension for an existing \ac{esom}. While successful in that regard, \ac{pygen}
could not overcome \ac{temoa}'s inherent limitations on optimizing multiple
objectives and the inability to modify its objective function. Addressing these
limits led to the development of \ac{osier}.


\subsection{Data for benchmark problems}
 In order to verify \ac{osier}'s accuracy, this section analyzes an energy
system and compare the results against a representative \ac{esom}, \ac{temoa}.
For this problem, I chose to model the state of Illinois broadly and using
weather data from the Champaign-Urbana region due to its geographic centrality.
Chapter \ref{chapter:benchmark-results} presents the results from this problem,
with a variety of optimization criteria. This section describes the data used in
both models. The basic inputs for \ac{osier} and \ac{temoa} are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Time series data for
    \begin{itemize}
      \item electricity demand
      \item \ac{vre} production (e.g., solar or wind),
    \end{itemize} 
    \item and technology data.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
The time series data for electricity demand, wind energy, and solar energy, come
from \ac{uiuc}. All of the time series are averaged across several years to
simulate a ``typical'' year. I re-scaled the demand data by the total energy
demand for Illinois in order for the hourly demand to be on the same scale as
the default power units (MW) for \ac{osier} technologies. However, this
normalization choice is somewhat arbitrary. \ac{osier} automatically normalizes
the \ac{vre} time series because \ac{vre} capacity is a decision variable.
Figure \ref{fig:normalized_ldc} shows the normalized demand and load duration
curves.
