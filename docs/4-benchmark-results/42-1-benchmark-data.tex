\subsection{Data for benchmark problems}
 In order
to verify \ac{osier}'s accuracy, I analyze an energy system and compare the
results against a representative \ac{esom}, \ac{temoa}. For this problem, I
chose to model the state of Illinois broadly and using weather data from the
Champaign-Urbana region due to its geographic centrality. Chapter
\ref{chapter:benchmark-results} presents the results from this problem, with a
variety of optimization criteria. This section describes the data used in both
models. The basic inputs for \ac{osier} and \ac{temoa} are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Time series data for
    \begin{itemize}
      \item electricity demand
      \item \ac{vre} production (e.g., solar or wind),
    \end{itemize} 
    \item and technology data.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
The time series data for electricity demand, wind energy, and solar energy, come
from \ac{uiuc}. All of the time series are averaged across several years to
simulate a ``typical'' year. I re-scaled the demand data by the total energy
demand for Illinois in order for the hourly demand to be on the same scale as
the default power units (MW) for \ac{osier} technologies. However, this
normalization choice is somewhat arbitrary. \ac{osier} automatically normalizes
the \ac{vre} time series because \ac{vre} capacity is a decision variable.
Figure \ref{fig:normalized_ldc} shows the normalized demand and load duration
curves.
