\subsection{Exercise 2: Exploring objective space}
Since structural uncertainty persists regardless of the number of objectives
used, it's important to check the near-optimal objective space for alternative
solutions. In the first benchmark exercise, I used \ac{temoa} to calculate the
least-cost solution. Then I generated 30 alternative solutions with \ac{mga} as
described in Section \ref{section:mga} with a 10\% slack variable added to
\ac{temoa}'s objective function. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01} shows the
points from \ac{temoa} in red and \ac{osier}'s Pareto-front for the same problem
in black. The red- and gray-shaded regions are the sub-optimal spaces (i.e.,
within 10\% of any objective) for \ac{temoa} and \ac{osier}, respectively.
The solid black points indicates points along the Pareto-front, while the open
black points are points tested in early generations of the \ac{osier} simulation.
\footnote{There are many more tested points than shown in Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01}. 
For simplicity and clarity, Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01} shows a random subset
of points.}

  \caption{Compares the least-cost solutions between \acs{temoa}
  and \acs{osier} as well as their sub-optimal spaces. The least-cost solutions
  for \ac{osier} and \ac{temoa} are within 0.5\% of each other.}
  \label{fig:temoa-benchmark-01}
\end{figure}

First, \ac{temoa}'s least-cost solution is slightly better (within 0.5\%) than
\ac{osier}'s in terms of both cost and emissions. This happens because
\ac{temoa} optimizes energy dispatch slightly differently than \ac{osier}. In
particular, the initial storage value for energy storage technologies is a
decision variable in \ac{temoa} and not in \ac{osier}. A second reason for this
discrepancy has to do with convergence. \ac{osier}'s Pareto-front could likely
be improved with a lower convergence tolerance, but this would use additional
computational resources. Although, \ac{temoa} calculated an optimal solution
with slightly lower cost than \ac{osier}, modelers should not place too much
importance on this fact because \acp{esom} should be used to generate insight
rather than answers, due to the nature of the systems being modeled
\cite{decarolis_using_2011}.

Next, the sub-optimal spaces mostly overlap, indicating that \ac{temoa} could
find a solution with lower carbon emissions after sufficient iterations.
However, none of \ac{temoa}'s \ac{mga} solutions fall within \ac{osier}'s
sub-optimal space. This point highlights the necessity for \acl{moo}. The
objective of \ac{mga} is to produce a \textit{diverse subset} of points in the
sub-optimal region. \ac{mga} may capture appealing alternatives for some
unmodeled objective in the original problem, but it cannot guarantee that those
solutions will be an improvement along any other objective axis. This is
especially apparent here, where the least-cost solution happens also to be the
lowest carbon solution, for \ac{temoa}. The relatively small area where the two
\acp{esom} do not overlap is fully explained by the difference in their
least-cost solutions.

Even though \ac{moo} reduces structural uncertainty, it will always exist, as
discussed in Section \ref{section:uncertainty}. Therefore, identifying
alternative solutions by sampling points in the inferior region is still useful.
Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-02} focuses on the near-optimal space presented
in \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01} and shows both the complete set of near-optimal
solutions (green) and some randomly selected points, highlighted in red.

Both Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-01} and Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-02}
present solutions in the objective space. However, in order to be prescriptive,
the policy solutions must be formulated according to the decision space. In
other words, described according to the mix of technologies that produced a
solution. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03} presents the spread of results in
the decision space for each model. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}a shows
the spread of each technology present in \ac{osier}'s Pareto front. Figure
\ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}b shows the same, but also includes the randomly
selected points from \ac{osier}'s near-optimal space. Lastly, Figure
\ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}c shows the same kind of distribution for
\ac{temoa}'s \ac{mga} solutions. Presented in this way, the design space results
indicate which technologies are always or usually present. Technologies that are
absent in all cases, including the near-optimal solutions, may be safely
ignored. For \ac{osier}, these technologies include both types of coal, biomass,
and largely ignores wind energy. In \ac{temoa}'s results, there are no
technologies that are totally absent. This result is due to the imperative built
into standard \ac{mga} to identify solutions that are maximally different in
design space, whereas \ac{osier} randomly selected points in its inferior
region. This suggests one avenue for improving \ac{osier}.
