\subsection{Exercise 0: Validating a Simplified Approach}

This exercise considers three different cases with different technology mixes. The first case
includes natural gas and nuclear resources, the second case adds a wind resource, and the last 
case adds battery storage. Each case had seven days with an hourly resolution (168 timesteps). Both
algorithms were allowed to curtail excess energy and both were required to meet demand at all time
steps. Table \ref{tab:dispatch-results} summarizes the technologies available, the optimizer used, 
and the value of the objective function.

    \caption{Summary results for the three dispatch test cases.}
    \label{tab:dispatch-results}
    \input{tables/algorithm_comparison_results_edited.tex}
\end{table}

\noindent
The first two cases in Table \ref{tab:dispatch-results} show that the two algorithms had perfect
agreement. The two optimizers disagree on the final case with a battery storage technology. Figure
\ref{fig:dispatch-comparison} compares the dispatch results for the two optimizers.

    dispatch algorithm and plot b) was calculated with optimal dispatch.}
    \label{fig:dispatch-comparison}
\end{figure}

The optimal dispatch algorithm uses a linear programming formulation
to arrive at an optimal solution with perfect foresight. The logical dispatch algorithm
uses a rules-based approach to dispatch energy according to merit order. However, this
algorithm is myopic since dispatch is calculated serially.
