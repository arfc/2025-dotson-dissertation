\subsection{Exercise 1: Validating a Simplified Approach}

This exercise considers three different cases with different technology mixes.
The first case includes natural gas and nuclear resources, the second case adds
a wind resource, and the last case adds battery storage. Each case had seven
days with an hourly resolution (168 timesteps). Both algorithms were allowed to
curtail excess energy and both were required to meet demand at all time steps.
Table \ref{tab:dispatch-results} summarizes the technologies available, the
optimizer used, and the value of the objective function. 

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{Summary results for the three dispatch test cases.}
    \label{tab:dispatch-results}
    \input{tables/algorithm_comparison_results_edited.tex}
\end{table}

% \noindent
The first two cases in Table \ref{tab:dispatch-results} show perfect agreement between 
the two algorithms. However, they disagree on the final case
with a battery storage technology. Figure \ref{fig:dispatch-comparison} compares
the dispatch results for the two methods. Figure
\ref{fig:dispatch-comparison}a was calculated with the logical dispatch
algorithm and Figure \ref{fig:dispatch-comparison}b was calculated with the
optimal dispatch algorithm. These plots show that the two
algorithms dispatch the same amounts of wind and nuclear energy. However, the
two algorithms differ in their usage of battery storage which causes further
differences in the dispatch of natural gas and total curtailment.

    \caption{Comparison between dispatch results for two algorithms. Plot a) was
    calculated with a logical dispatch algorithm and plot b) was calculated with
    optimal dispatch.}
    \label{fig:dispatch-comparison}
\end{figure}

The optimal dispatch algorithm uses a linear programming formulation to arrive
at an optimal solution with perfect foresight. The logical dispatch algorithm
uses a rule-based approach to dispatch energy according to merit order.
However, this algorithm is myopic since dispatch is calculated serially. These
differences totally account for the differences in their dispatch results. The
optimal dispatch algorithm uses battery storage more effectively than its
rule-based counterpart because it optimizes the entire time series at once.
Since the logical algorithm uses battery storage imperfectly, it fills the
energy gaps with natural gas and more energy is curtailed rather than used.
Although, the optimal dispatch solution performs better on a pure cost basis, the
myopia of the logical dispatch algorithm is possibly more realistic.
Further, since the logical dispatch algorithm does not have an energy balance
constraint for all time steps, users can more easily estimate reliability and
calculate costs from energy shortfalls.

\subsection{Exercise 2: Time Scaling}

This exercise considers how the two dispatch algorithms scale with simulation duration.
For this exercise, the two algorithms were placed within a
\texttt{CapacityExpansion} problem with the parameters described in Table
\ref{tab:scaling-ga-params}.

\begin{table}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \caption{Capacity expansion parameters for the algorithm comparison exercise.}
    \label{tab:scaling-ga-params}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        Parameter & Value \\
        \midrule
        Algorithm & \acs{nsga2}\\
        Termination Criterion & Maximum generations\\
        Generations & 10 \\
        Population Size & 20 \\
        Objectives & 2 (cost, emissions)\\
        Threads & 1 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent The available technologies were the same four as in the previous
exercise. Rather than scaling the problem by number of objectives, technologies,
or population size, this exercise scales the problem by the length of the time
series. This is preferred because time series data typically increases the
problem size more dramatically than the number of objectives or number of
technologies. Further, scaling by population size would obfuscate the
differences between the two algorithms since neither are affected by population
size. Figure \ref{fig:alg-scaling} shows results of this scaling study. The
x-axis measures the number of modeled days at an hourly resolution.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \resizebox{0.75\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/04_benchmark_chapter/algorithm_scaling_plot.pgf}}
    \caption{Time scaling of a capacity expansion problem using either an optimal or logical dispatch algorithm.}
    \label{fig:alg-scaling}
\end{figure}

\noindent Initially, the logical dispatch algorithm outperforms the optimal
dispatch algorithm by nearly two orders of magnitude. This is because the linear
program has some overhead when writing and copying equations that the rule-based
calculation does not. The logical algorithm initially grows more quickly until
the models reach 100 modeled days after which the two algorithms scale
similarly and the logical dispatch algorithm remains approximately 2.5 times
faster than its optimal counterpart.

\subsection{Exercise 3: Parallelization}

\Acp{ga} are considered ``embarrassingly parallelizable'' since the performance
of each individual in a population is independent from the others. However, there
a some difficulties with solving multiple parallel instances of \ac{lp} solvers
since these solvers frequently have some parallel optimizations built-in. For
now, this restricts capacity expansion problems within \ac{osier} that use linear 
programming to serial calculations. This is not so for the logical dispatch algorithm 
since it does
not use an \ac{lp} solver. Therefore, this exercise looks exclusively at how the
logical dispatch algorithm scales with number of threads available. Once again,
the dispatch algorithm is driven by \ac{osier}'s \texttt{CapacityExpansion}
class whose parameters are described in Table \ref{tab:thread-scaling-params}. 

\begin{table}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \caption{Capacity expansion parameters for the parallelization exercise.}
    \label{tab:thread-scaling-params}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        Parameter & Value \\
        \midrule
        Algorithm & \acs{nsga2}\\
        Termination Criterion & Maximum Generations\\
        Generations & 10 \\
        Objectives & 2 (cost, emissions)\\
        Timesteps & 120 (5 days x 24 hours)\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent In this exercise, the problem is scaled by the population size of each
generation. The study was performed on a 2024 MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro CPU, 
48 GB of RAM, and the macOS Sequoia 15.5 operating system. Figure
\ref{fig:thread-scaling} shows the results for this exercise.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \resizebox{0.75\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/04_benchmark_chapter/thread_scaling_plot.pgf}}
    \caption{Time scaling of a capacity expansion problem using a range of
    threads for parallelization.}
    \label{fig:thread-scaling}
\end{figure}

All simulations perform similarly when the problem size is small
because multithreading has some overhead. Multiple threads outperformed the
single threaded simulation in every case. Eight threads outperformed twelve
threads in the middle of the population range, but otherwise performed
similarly. Simulations with two and four threads performed similarly until the
higher end of the population range where four threads proved faster. The overall
speed improvement from multithreading was modest with a roughly four second
improvement at best. This suggests that further code optimization could improve
performance and that better computer architecture might be needed to fully
realize the parallelization enhancement.
