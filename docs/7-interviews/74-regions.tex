\section{Case Regions}
\label{section:cases}

The case regions for this study were chosen to cover a breadth of energy
planning circumstances. Collectively, the regions cover the entire spectrum of
possibilities illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:illinois-flow-chart}. Table
\ref{tab:demographics} shows the sizes of each planning context by population.

\subsection{State of Illinois}
Illinois is the largest region considered in this study and the state in which
all other case municipalities are located. Given the downward pressure Illinois
exerts onto municipalities within its territory, understanding how energy
decisions are made at the state level is essential context for understanding
energy choices elsewhere within the state. There are several important
energy-related entities that operate in Illinois.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \acf{icc} --- The \ac{icc} regulates \acp{iou}, including electricity,
    gas, and water utilities. The \ac{icc} presides over rate cases, proceedings
    that set utility delivery rates which go towards cost recovery for
    \acp{iou}. The Commission is charged with balancing ``the interests of
    consumers and public utilities to ensure adequate, efficient, reliable,
    safe, and least-cost utility services, while promoting the development of an
    effectively competitive energy supplier market''
    \cite{illinois_commerce_commision_icc_citizens_2022}.
    \item \acf{ipa} --- The \ac{ipa} is responsible for developing annual
    procurement plans and manages power purchases for residential and small
    commercial customers who have not switched to an \ac{ares} (i.e., customers
    that receive ``default supply'').
    \item Illinois \acf{cub} --- the Illinois \ac{cub} was formed in 1983 after
    Illinois passed the Citizen's Utility Board Act
    \cite{illinois_83rd_general_assembly_citizens_1983}. The \ac{cub} is a
    nonpartisan organization that educates consumers and advocates for public
    health and affordable utilities at the \ac{icc}. Indeed, the \ac{cub} Act
    afforded the organization regulatory standing, which allows it to
    introduce bills at the regulatory level. \ac{cub} also intervenes at the
    municipal level in front of city councils. Particularly those with
    municipally-owned utilities, such as Naperville, Illinois.
    \item \acf{imea} --- The \ac{imea} is a non-profit business known as a joint
    action agency that procures electricity on behalf of its 32 member
    municipalities through energy purchases on the open electricity market and
    full or partial ownership of generating resources. All of \ac{imea}'s member
    municipalities operate their own utilities independently from Ameren or ComeEd.
    \item \acf{icea} --- The \ac{icea} is a lobbying organization that
    represents the interests of various \acp{ares} and ``advance retail
    competition, customer choice, and competitive retail energy issues in the
    electricity and gas markets before the \ac{icc}, and the Illinois
    Legislature and among stakeholders, policymakers, and the media."
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
In 2021, Illinois legislators passed the \ac{ceja} bill
\cite{harmon_climate_2021}, which did several things for Illinois, such as
\begin{enumerate}
    \item setting a target of 100\% clean energy by 2050,
    \item establishing a ``Zero Emissions Credit'' to support financially
    struggling nuclear plants in \ac{pjm} and,
    \item equity-focused workforce development programs, including a \acf{mes}
    for \ac{ipa} administered programs.
\end{enumerate}
Building on this foundational legislation, Illinois published its \ac{pcap} in
2024. This climate plan identifies economy-wide strategies for Illinois to meet
its commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement by halving its total carbon
emissions by 2030 (relative to 2005 levels) \cite{kibbey_state_2024}. Figure
\ref{fig:uiuc-emissions} shows Illinois trajectory for decarbonization. Along
with setting specific targets to produce 50\% clean electricity by 2040 and
100\% by 2050, \ac{pcap} outlines the need for statewide clean energy modeling
and asserts that ``energy modeling will help ensure that Illinois has clean
energy resources to backfill retiring fossil fuel plants and stay the course for
\ac{ceja}'s decarbonization timeline'' \cite{kibbey_state_2024}. \ac{pcap} does
not define the terms ``justice'' or ``environmental justice,'' but it does
describe two types of ``Equity Investment Eligible Communities'':
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Environmental justice communities} that were identified by
    the U.S. EPA as having a higher risk of exposure to pollution based on
    environmental and socioeconomic factors.
    \item \textit{Restore. Reinvest. Renew. (R3 Areas)}, communities that have
    been harmed by violence, excessive incarceration, and economic
    disinvestment.
\end{enumerate}
These equity-eligible communities are intended to receive at least 40\% of
the benefits from solar energy and energy efficiency programs, workforce development,
and contractor accelerator programs, electric vehicle deployment, and utility
infrastructure planning \cite{kibbey_state_2024}.

\subsection{\acf{uiuc}} 

The \acl{uiuc} (\acs{uiuc} or ``The University''), Illinois' largest university,
straddles the two municipalities of Champaign and Urbana, and its student
enrollment rivals the populations of its neighbors. \ac{uiuc} has a uniquely
diverse energy system, including a wholly owned subsidiary company, \ac{pei},
which owns and operates energy supply and distribution for the campus
\cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}. \ac{pei} also enables \ac{uiuc}
to participate in the open electricity market, buying and selling wholesale
electricity. On the supply side, \ac{pei} owns a coal and natural gas
cogeneration plant, Abbott Power Plant, which produces steam and electricity for
the campus, as well as a chilled water storage system. \ac{uiuc} also has
\acp{ppa} for wind \cite{breitweiser_wind_2016} and solar energy
\cite{white_solar_2017, white_solar_2020} along with solar panels on several
campus buildings. On the distribution side, \ac{pei} operates steam, electric,
and gas distribution for the campus. 

\ac{uiuc} published three climate action plans called the \acf{icap}. The most recent
\ac{icap} was published in 2020
\cite{institute_for_sustainability_energy_and_environment_illinois_2020}. This
climate action plan commits \ac{uiuc} to achieving a net-zero campus emissions
from all energy sectors by 2050 through a mix of new clean energy resources and
energy efficiency measures. Figure \ref{fig:uiuc-emissions} shows the current
progress, as of 2023, and the ultimate trajectory of this net-zero goal. The
\ac{icap} also covers broader sustainability targets related to water use,
recycling, and clean transportation. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \resizebox{0.75\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/07_interview_chapter/uiuc_emissions_plot.pgf}}
    \caption{Annual emissions and targets for the state of Illinois and
    \ac{uiuc} from 2008 to 2050.}
    \label{fig:uiuc-emissions}
\end{figure}
The \ac{icap} defines sustainability as ``meeting the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs.'' This definition is consistent with the concept of intergenerational
equity, an aspect of distributive justice, described in Section
\ref{section:energy-justice}. Further, the report outlines an objective to
``develop a comprehensive environmental justice plan'' that focuses on
historically marginalized and underserved communities. This objective
demonstrates some consideration for recognition justice as well.

\subsection{Champaign and Urbana, Illinois}
Champaign and Urbana are neighboring cities surrounding \ac{uiuc}, which drives
most of the economic activity in the area. Both cities lie in the \ac{miso}
region of Illinois and receive electricity through the regulated utility,
Ameren. Although they share some resources, they have not coordinated on a shared
climate action plan. Additionally, neither city has a current climate action
plan. Urbana's most recent climate action plan spanned 2015 through 2020
\cite{ryan_climate_2014} and Champaign's ``Growing Greener'' plan has not been
updated since 2013 \cite{knight_champaign_2013}. Both plans suggest purchasing
\acp{rec} to cover 100\% of electricity use through \ac{mca} with an \ac{ares}.
However, Urbana's plan goes somewhat further by identifying strategies to
purchase bundled \acp{rec}\footnote{A \ac{rec} can either be \textit{bundled} or
\textit{unbundled}. The former are \acp{rec} that are packaged with the specific
megawatt-hour that generated the \ac{rec}. The latter refers to \acp{rec} that
are traded separately from energy and are generally less expensive.} and install
\ac{btm} solar panels on city facilities. Both climate plans mention ``social
equity'' and although equity is never defined, mentions of equity are
concomitant with access to services and opportunities. This suggests a focus on
the distributive aspect of justice described in Section
\ref{section:energy-justice}.

\subsection{Naperville, Illinois}
Naperville is an affluent suburb of Chicago, Illinois that straddles Will and
DuPage counties. The city operates its own electric utility but does not own any
bulk generation sources. Instead, Naperville contracts with the \ac{imea}
organization to procure electricity for its residents. The Naperville City
Council offers two ``sustainability'' plans. First is the Sustainability
Workplan, which is a brief document outlining the city's commitments
\cite{mjolness_city_2025}. The Workplan has no quantified objectives or
timelines and its energy goals are narrowly focused on efficiency improvements such as
installing LED lights. The second is a report authored by volunteers with the
\acf{nest} entitled ``Sustainable Naperville 2036''
\cite{trendler_sustainable_2021}. Although \ac{nest} is an advisory organization
formed by the Naperville City Council, the targets outlined in this plan are not
commitments set forth by the city council. The \ac{nest} report proposed
strategies to limit Naperville's carbon emissions to 0.968 million metric tonnes
of \ac{co2eq} by 2036 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The primary
means of reducing carbon emissions identified in the report are expanding local
energy generation and eliminating electricity supplied from the Prairie State
Coal Plant --- a coal plant partially owned by \ac{imea}, which procures
electricity for its member communities, including Naperville. The 2036 report
also identified ``energy equity'' as a sustainability objective. Although equity
is not explicitly defined, the authors describe disproportionality and implore
that
\begin{quote}
    \blockcquote[11]{trendler_sustainable_2021}{it is imperative that
    sustainability planning and actions pro-actively account for human and
    environmental  
    impacts from emissions, pollution and natural resource destruction created
    by Naperville's energy purchases and  consumption --- beyond our immediate
    community boundaries as well as those created within.}
\end{quote}
