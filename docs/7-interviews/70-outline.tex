\section{Introduction}

\textcolor{red}{Note for later: One of the key patterns I found in the
interviews was that, although many interviewees were empathetic to
justice-related efforts and initiatives, those initiatives were delegated to a
dedicated person or department within governing institutions. This suggests
there is more work to be done integrating energy justice and energy
modeling/policy-making}

Earlier chapters introduced a novel modeling tool, \ac{osier}, which sought to
fill a gap in the literature and available modeling tools by developing a
flexible multi-objective optimization framework that allows users to incorporate
concepts of justice, the ``human dimension'' \cite{pfenninger_energy_2014}. This
is possible because \ac{osier} enables users to optimize any quantifiable
objective which encourages modelers to seek input from the communities they
model for their energy system priorities, as suggested by McGookin et al. 2024
\cite{mcgookin_advancing_2024}, thereby elevating the recognition and procedural
aspects of justice described in Chapter \ref{chapter:lit-review}. Additionally,
\ac{osier} transcends scale limitations due to it's flexible design, making it
useful for municipalities as well as larger governing units. This chapter
attempts to validate these assertions by examining how local and state energy
planners use \acp{esom} and the ways in which justice does or does not play a
role in decision-making. To that end, this chapter considers a range of contexts
in the State of Illinois, including three municipalities (Champaign, Urbana, and
Naperville), a university with its own microgrid (\acf{uiuc}), and Illinois
energy organizations (\acf{icc}, \acf{ipa}, \acf{icea}, and the Illinois
\acf{cub}). This chapter also considers the varied perspectives of different
energy planning participants within their respective contexts by interviewing
city planners, a city council member, and various advisory staff. This study
contributes to the existing literature on participatory and distributed energy
planning as well as illustrating a path towards a holistic integration of energy
justice and energy system engineering.

The next section reviews the existing literature on decentralized energy
planning. Section \ref{section:interview-methods} describes the method for
collecting and analyzing interview data using thematic analysis. Section
\ref{section:cases} introduces the different cases considered in this chapter.
\textcolor{red}{Lastly, an analysis and discussion of the interviews.}


\section{Literature Review}
Chapter \ref{chapter:lit-review} provided a broad review of the existing
literature that contextualizes this thesis. This section offers a focused review
of the literature on municipal energy planning and modeling practices.

\subsection{Municipal use of energy models}

Energy modeling has focused on energy systems at national and regional scales
due to the traditionally centralized nature of energy infrastructure. However,
the spread of \acp{der} suggests that municipalities have an opportunity to play
a larger role in shaping the clean energy transition
\cite{shen_facilitating_2021}. Despite this, both Ben Amer et al. 2020, and
Johannsen et al. 2021 found that \acp{esom} are seldom used at the municipal
level \cite{ben_amer_too_2020,johannsen_designing_2021}. These studies agree
that municipal planners do not have time nor the requisite expertise to use
\acp{esom} themselves and generally hire consultants to perform the analyses,
when needed. They further argue that municipal planners do not employ \acp{esom}
because input data are difficult to find, the models do not have a scope
suitable for municipalities, and they lack desirable features. Indeed,
S\"{u}sser et al. investigated the needs of modelers and users and found that
modelers prioritize ``realism'' and complexity while users prefer
understandability and clear communication \cite{susser_better_2022}. All three
studies conclude that greater collaboration and earlier involvement between
modelers and planners would yield superior results. Only Ben Amer et al.
identify consulting and personnel costs as potential barriers to incorporating
modeling results into decision making processes.

% \textcolor{red}{Is the hypothesis I am testing with this study that
% ``municipalities would be better equipped to plan and design their energy
% systems if the available modeling tools were accessible and relevant.'' This
% hypothesis comes from the implicit suppositions in a few papers. }

\subsection{Energy justice and planning}

There is, to date, limited empirical work that investigates the inclusion of
justice into formal planning proceses at either state or municipal levels. One
study by Diezmart\'inez et al. looked at 58 climate action plans sampled from
the 100 largets U.S. cities \cite{diezmartinez_us_2022}. This study found that,
of the 58 climate action plans, roughly two-thirds of them attend to either
justice or equity, while the final third do not discuss either concept. The
researchers also found that recency, high levels of inequality within a city,
and public engagement were determining factors in whether a climate action plan
addressed justice. Further, climate action plans developed by cities prefer
``equity'' over ``justice'' because discourses tend to focus on the superficial
distributions of benefits and burdens rather than accounting for structural
sources of injustice \cite{diezmartinez_us_2022}.

Another study reviewed 60 energy transition ``visioning documents'' prepared by
non-profits and advocacy organizations in the United States, rather than formal
planning documents developed by city officials \cite{elmallah_frontlining_2022}.
This study found 6 principles of planning for energy justice.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Being place-based --- recognizing that each city's situation is unique
    and that there are no universal solutions.
    \item Addressing the root cause and legacies of inequality
    \item Shifting the balance of power from existing forms of energy governance
    \item Creating new, cooperative, and participatory systems of energy governance and ownership
    \item Adopting a rights-based approach
    \item Rejecting false solutions
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Modeling for justice}

Discuss the paper \cite{lonergan_energy_2023}

\subsection{Novelty of this work}

\textcolor{red}{What are some of the novelties of the present study}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Considers structural barriers to energy modeling.
    \item Investigates the role concepts of energy justice do (or do not) play
    in energy policy for some places in Illinois.
    \item Evaluates a specific energy modeling tool and features of that tool.
\end{enumerate}
 
% This section answers the following questions \begin{enumerate} \item Where do
% consumers get their energy from? For example, the open energy market, their
% municipality, municipal electric aggregation, or some default supply decided
% by the state of Illinois. \item How do suppliers of electricity, decide what
% types of generators in which to invest? For example, the \ac{imea} procures
% electricity on behalf of their member communities from the open market, and
% also owns part of the Prairie coal plant. \end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}
\label{section:interview-methods}

\subsection{Thematic Analysis}
This section describes a multiple-case study using interviews with energy
planners, decision makers, and community advocates at local and state levels.
The interviewees were chosen to exemplify maximum variation cases
\cite{flyvbjerg_five_2006}. The participants and cases in this study vary in
perspective and context in order to create a holistic narrative about energy
planning within Illinois. A multiple-case study also enhances validity by
enabling replication and comparison \cite{johannsen_designing_2021,
yin_case_2018}. Further, since one purpose of this study is to evaluate the
design and applicability of the tool, \ac{osier}, a multiple-case study design
will strengthen software changes and feature additions and support \ac{osier}'s
use in other locations and contexts. The raw data include interview transcriptions
and the relevant municipal climate and energy plans, if available. The
interviews were transcribed with the ``listen and revise method'' using the
Whisper transcription tool \cite{battaglia_listen_2024}. Whisper uses \ac{ai} to
automate the transcription process. Both the data and the \ac{ai} model used to
transcribe the interview audio were hosted locally (i.e., without an internet
connection), eliminating privacy concerns \cite{battaglia_listen_2024}. Figure
\ref{fig:whisper} shows a screenshot of the Whisper interface. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{figures/07_interview_chapter/whisper-screenshot.png}
    \caption{A screenshot of an interview transcribed with Whisper. To protect
    the privacy of the interviewees, only ``Speaker 1'' is shown. ``Speaker 1''
    is the author of this thesis.}
    \label{fig:whisper}
\end{figure}

The transcribed interviews were initially coded using a deductive approach aligned with three aims of this study:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item identify how (if) energy models are used to support energy planning at
    local and state levels,
    \item determine the ways energy justice or equity are incorporated into
    planning decisions
    \item assess the usefulness of a new modeling tool, \ac{osier}.
\end{enumerate} 
However, I combined this with an inductive process to develop additional codes. The benefits
of this hybrid strategy are that it allows comparing and contrasting the results of the present study with existing
literature while producing insights novel to this study.
The interview coding step was also performed locally with the \texttt{Taguette}
tool \cite{rampin_taguette_2021}. Figure \ref{fig:taguette} shows a screenshot
of the \texttt{Taguette} software.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

    \caption{A screenshot of the interview transcribed in Figure \ref{fig:whisper}
    loaded into \texttt{Taguette} for initial coding.}
    \label{fig:taguette}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interview Data Collection}

A total of thirteen interviews were conducted virtually using the Zoom
teleconferencing software through the second half of 2024 and beginning of 2025
using a semi-structured approach based on an interview guide designed according
to five main topics (for details, see Appendix \ref{chapter:interview-guide}).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Background --- learn about the interviewees experience and background
    with energy planning in their context.
    \item Existing planning processes --- clarify the processes used to develop
    climate action plans and energy policies.
    \item Conceptions of justice or equity --- elucidate the extent to which
    justice informs energy policies and plans.
    \item Use of models in planning processes --- identify if energy models are
    used and overall perceptions of modeling.
    \item Assessment of the \ac{osier} tool --- introduce \ac{osier} through a
    short presentation and invite reactions and feedback from the interviewee.
\end{enumerate}
The interviewees were chosen through a combination of purposive and snowball
sampling to identify staff with sufficient and relevant energy planning
experience. Each interviewee is involved in decision making, planning, or
advocacy in their respective context. 
Table \ref{tab:interviewees} summarizes the interviewees for this study. The
\textit{organization} column refers to the organization that either employs, or is
represented by, the interviewee. The \textit{type} column assigns the
interviewee a broad category including
\begin{enumerate}
    \item practicioner --- someone involved in the process of energy planning
    and/or carries out policy directives from policy makers,
    \item advocate --- a person or organization that lobbies for policy outcomes
    on behalf of a group of stakeholders,
    \item policy maker --- someone that participates in the ultimate decision
    making related to energy policy.
\end{enumerate}
    
\begin{table}[ht!]

\section{Case Regions}
\label{section:cases}

The case regions for this study were chosen to cover a breadth of energy
planning circumstances. Collectively, the regions cover the entire spectrum of
possibilities illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:illinois-flow-chart}. Table
\ref{tab:demographics} shows the sizes of each planning context by population.

\end{figure}

\subsection{State of Illinois}
Illinois is the largest region considered in this study and the state in which
all other case municipalities are located. Given the downward pressure Illinois
exerts onto municipalities within its territory, understanding how energy
decisions are made at the state level is essential context for understanding
energy choices elsewhere within the state. There are several important
energy-related entities that operate in Illinois.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \acf{icc} --- The \ac{icc} regulates \acp{iou} including electricity,
    gas, and water utilities. The \ac{icc} presides over rate cases, proceedings
    that set utility delivery rates which go towards cost recovery for
    \acp{iou}. The Commission is charged with balancing ``the interests of
    consumers and public utilities to ensure adequate, efficient, reliable,
    safe, and least-cost utility services, while promoting the development of an
    effectively competitive energy supplier market''
    \cite{illinois_commerce_commision_icc_citizens_2022}.
    \item \acf{ipa} --- The \ac{ipa} is responsible for developing annual
    procurement plans and manages power purchases for residential and small
    commercial customers that have not switched to an \ac{ares} (i.e., customers
    that receive ``default supply'').
    \item Illinois \acf{cub} --- the Illinois \ac{cub} formed in 1983 after
    Illinois passed the Citizen's Utility Board Act
    \cite{illinois_83rd_general_assembly_citizens_1983}. The \ac{cub} is a
    nonpartisan organization that educates consumers and advocates for public
    health and affordable utilities at the \ac{icc}. Indeed, the \ac{cub} Act
    afforded the orgnanization regulatory standing which allows them to
    introduce bills at the regulatory level. \ac{cub} also intervenes at the
    municipal level in front of city councils. Particularly those with
    municipally-owned utilities, such as Naperville, Illinois.
    \item \acf{imea} --- The \ac{imea} is a non-profit business known as a joint
    action agency that procures electricity on behalf its 32 member
    municipalities through energy purchases on the open electricity market and
    full or partial ownership of generating resources. All of \ac{imea}'s member
    municipalities operate their own utilties independent from Ameren or ComeEd.
    \item \acf{icea} --- The \ac{icea} is a lobbying organization that
    represents the interests of various \acp{ares} and ``advance retail
    competition, customer choice, and competitive retail energy issues in the
    electricity and gas markets before the \ac{icc}, and the Illinois
    Legislature and among stakeholders, policymakers, and the media."
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Illinois legislators passed the \ac{ceja} bill \cite{harmon_climate_2021} which
did several things for Illinois such as
\begin{enumerate}
    \item setting a target of 100\% clean energy by 2050,
    \item establishing a ``Zero Emissions Credit'' to support financially
    struggling nuclear plants in \ac{pjm} and,
    \item equity-focused workforce development programs, including a \acf{mes}
    for \ac{ipa} administered programs.
\end{enumerate}
In essence, \ac{ceja} constitutes the electricity sector portion of Illinois'
climate action plan.

\subsection{Champaign and Urbana, Illinois}
Champaign and Urbana are neighboring cities surrounding \ac{uiuc}, which drives
most of the economic activity in the area. Both cities lie in the \ac{miso}
region of Illinois and receive electricity through the regulated utility,
Ameren. Although they share some resources they have not coordinated on a shared
climate action plan. Additionally, neither city has a current climate action
plan. Urbana's most recent climate action plan spanned 2015 through 2020
\cite{ryan_climate_2014} and Champaign's ``Growing Greener'' plan has not been
updated since 2013 \cite{knight_champaign_2013}. Both plans suggest purchasing
\acp{rec} to cover 100\% of electricity-use through \ac{mca} with an \ac{ares}.
However, Urbana's plan goes somewhat further by identifying strategies to
purchase bundled \acp{rec}\footnote{A \ac{rec} can either be \textit{bundled} or
\textit{unbundled}. The former are \acp{rec} that are packaged with the specific
megawatthour that generated the \ac{rec}. The latter refers to \acp{rec} that
are traded separately from energy and are generally less expensive.} and install
\ac{btm} on city facilities. Both climate plans mention ``social equity'' and
although equity is never defined, mentions of equity are concomitant with access
to services and opportunities. This suggests a focus on the distributive aspect
of justice described in Section \ref{section:energy-justice}.

\subsection{\acf{uiuc}} 

The \acl{uiuc} (\acs{uiuc} or ``The University''), Illinois' largest university,
straddles the two municipalities of Champaign and Urbana and its student
enrollment rivals the populations of its neighbors. \ac{uiuc} has uniquely
diverse energy system including a wholly owned subsidiary company, \ac{pei},
that owns and operates energy supply and distribution for the campus
\cite{affiliated_engineers_inc_utilities_2015}. \ac{pei} also enables \ac{uiuc}
to participate in the open electricity market, buying and selling wholesale
electricity. On the supply side, \ac{pei} owns a coal and natural gas
cogeneration plant, Abbott Power Plant, which produces steam and electricity for
the campus, as well as a chilled water storage system. \ac{uiuc} also has
\acp{ppa} for wind \cite{breitweiser_wind_2016} and solar energy
\cite{white_solar_2017, white_solar_2020} along with solar panels on several
campus buildings. On the distribution side, \ac{pei} operates steam, electric,
and gas distribution for the campus. 

\ac{uiuc} published three climate action plans called \ac{icap}. The most recent
\ac{icap} was published in 2020
\cite{institute_for_sustainability_energy_and_environment_illinois_2020}. This
climate action plan commits \ac{uiuc} to achieving net-zero campus emissions
from all energy sectors by 2050 through a mix of new clean energy resources and
energy efficiency measures. Figure \ref{fig:uiuc-emissions} shows the current
progress, as of 2023, and the ultimate trajectory of this net-zero goal. The
\ac{icap} also covers broader sustainability targets related to water use,
recycling, and clean transportation. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \resizebox{0.75\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/07_interview_chapter/uiuc_emissions_plot.pgf}}
    \caption{Annual emissions and targets at \ac{uiuc} from 2008 to 2050.}
    \label{fig:uiuc-emissions}
\end{figure}
The \ac{icap} defines sustainability as ``meeting the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs.'' This definition is consistent with the concept of intergenerational
equity, an aspect of distribution justice, described in Section
\ref{section:energy-justice}. Further, the report outlines an objective to
``develop a comprehensive environmental justice plan'' that focuses on
historically marginalized and underserved communities. This objective
demonstrates some consideration for recognition justice as well.


\subsection{Naperville, Illinois}
Naperville is an affluent suburb of Chicago, Illinois that straddles Will and
DuPage counties. The city operates its own electric utility but does not own any
bulk generation sources. Instead, Naperville contracts with the \ac{imea}
organization to procure electricity for its residents. The Naperville city
council offers two ``sustainability'' plans. First is the Sustainability
Workplan, which is a brief document outlining the city's commitments
\cite{mjolness_city_2025}. The Workplan has no quantified objectives nor
timelines and its energy goals are restricted to efficiency improvements such as
installing LED lights. Second, is a report authored by volunteers with the
\acf{nest} entitled ``Sustainable Naperville 2036''
\cite{trendler_sustainable_2021}. Although \ac{nest} is an advisory organization
formed by the Naperville City Council, the targets outlined in this plan are not
commitments set forth by the city council. The \ac{nest} report proposed
strategies to limit Naperville's carbon emissions to 0.968 million metric tonnes
of \ac{co2eq} by 2036 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The primary
means of reducing carbon emissions identified in the report are expanding local
energy generation and eliminating electricity supplied from the Prairie State
Coal Plant --- a coal plant partially owned by \ac{imea} which procures
electricity for its member communities, including Naperville. The 2036 report
also identified ``energy equity'' as a sustainability objective. Although equity
is not explicitly defined, the authors describe disproportionality and implore
that
\begin{quote}
    \blockcquote[11]{trendler_sustainable_2021}{it is imperative that
    sustainability planning and actions pro-actively account for human and
    environmental  
    impacts from emissions, pollution and natural resource destruction created
    by Naperville's energy purchases and  consumption --- beyond our immediate
    community boundaries as well as those created within.}
\end{quote}

\section{Energy Procurement in Illinois}

This section describes the ways consumers and municipalities procure electricity
in Illinois. This brief interlude provides essential context for understanding the structural barriers
preventing municipalities from taking advantage of energy modeling tools to aid
planning and elucidates the frequently limited scope of municipal energy plans.
Figure \ref{fig:illinois-flow-chart} provides a visual guide for electricity
procurement from the perspective of an individual consumer with arrows
indicating directional relationships.

First, Illinois belongs to two \acp{rto}, \ac{pjm} and \ac{miso}, which conduct
wholesale energy auctions through which market participants purchase
electricity. Residential customers do not participate directly in open energy
market. Instead they interface with a utility or municipality which procures
electricity on their behalf. Some municipalities, such as Naperville, own their
own utilities. Second, Illinois restructured its electricity market in 1997,
prohibiting \aclp{iou} from owning both transmission infrastructure and
generating infrastructure \cite{illinois_90th_general_assembly_electric_1997}.
This means that \acp{iou} must purchase electricity on the open market rather
than having in-house generation. Municipally-owned utilities are exempt from
this rule. Finally, the deregulation of Illinois' electricity market limits the
state legislature's ability to force the construction of new generation or the
retirement of old generation. The legislature can direct the \ac{ipa} to procure
a certain amount of generation from specific generators and the legislature may
enact policies which incentivize desirable generators to come to Illinois.


\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{figures/07_interview_chapter/illinois-electric-choice.drawio.png}
    % \resizebox{0.75\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/07_interview_chapter/illinois-electric-choice.drawio.svg}}
    \caption{A flow chart describing how consumers may procure electricity in
    Illinois. \textcolor{red}{!! NOT FINAL !!}}
    \label{fig:illinois-flow-chart}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:illinois-flow-chart} shows consumers residing within
municipalities. Municipalities that own and operate a utility may obtain
electric supply by owning electric generation, participating in the energy
market, or contracting with another organization, such as the \ac{imea}, to
handle the supply procurement. In turn, \ac{imea} can procure energy by owning
generating capacity, or through the energy market. Most municipalities in
Illinois are served by one of the two major \acp{iou}, Ameren or ComEd. Due to
the Public Utilities Act of 1997, these utilities cannot profit on the supply of
electricity \cite{illinois_90th_general_assembly_electric_1997}. Rather, their
customers (consumers or municipalities) direct the utility to supply electricity
from a chosen supplier. If customers do not choose a supplier, they will receive
the default supply, procured by the \ac{ipa}. In Illinois, consumers can opt for
their municipality (where allowed) to negotiate electricity prices on their
behalf through \ac{mca}. Municipalities may either select from an \ac{ares} or
choose the default supply.\footnote{An \ac{ares} is an entity certified by the
\ac{icc} that sells electricity to customers. This electricity is generated
through privately owned resources or through purchases from the electricity
market.} Although not depicted in Figure \ref{fig:illinois-flow-chart},
consumers that reside in a municipality without \ac{mca} may still choose to
purchase electricity supply from an \ac{ares} as an individual. Of course,
consumers and municipalities may, where permitted, obtain energy by investing in
\ac{btm} resources, commonly rooftop solar panels or batteries. Municipalities
that currently outsource their electricity procurement to \ac{imea} are
contractually prohibited from building certain \ac{btm} resources.

\section{Results}
This section explores the results from the analysis of thirteen interviews. It is organized
according to \textcolor{red}{X} number of themes derived from thematic analysis.

\subsection{Existing planning processes}
\subsection{Energy model usage}

None of the municipalities considered in this study, Naperville, Champaign,
Urbana, nor \ac{uiuc}, use \acp{esom} to guide energy planning and investment
decisions. At the state level, the \ac{ipa} use modeling \textit{results} to inform
policy recommendations but the modeling itself was outsourced to an external consultant.

Practitioners also understood modeling differently from the definition of \acp{esom}.
Two interviewees, UI1 and CP1, indicated that ``energy models'' were used but described
\acp{bem}, which are distinct from \acp{esom} because they focus on the flow of \textit{heat}
energy into and and throughout a building. \acp{bem} are useful for identifying efficiency measures
but are not mathematical optimization tools.


\subsection{Considerations of justice in energy planning}
\textcolor{red}{I think this section should be broken into three or four sub-sections, one
for each aspect of justice and how it is considered in planning processes...}

At both the state and municipal levels, energy justice considerations are driven
primarily by advocacy groups, such as \ac{cub} and \ac{nest}, lobbying for its
inclusion in policy. 

[... include quotes here ]

Although several practitioners expressed interest in energy justice and related
concepts, institutions such as the \ac{ipa} and municipal governments have
specific staff dedicated to equity and justice. \textcolor{red}{[... share
examples and quotes here ...]}. 

[... How do the interviewees feel about this separation and /or energy justice
in general? ]

Despite tension, advocacy groups in Illinois gained some significant ground with
\ac{ceja}'s passage in 2021. In the words of interviewee IA2:

\begin{quote}
    We have to incorporate into law, not just affordability, but environmental
    justice, utility justice, utility democracy, all of these other concepts.
    And you know, did we get a law that properly focused all those things?
    Definitely not. But it did introduce these concepts into Illinois in, I
    think, a pretty significant way.
\end{quote}

Other items to discuss
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What does community engagement look like?
    \item Who is recognized as a stakeholder?
    \item Is there an apparent tension between justice and effective outcomes?
    (two examples: local food vs equity requirement and the idea that someone
    will be unhappy with the outcome and thus blame the process...)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Structural barriers to energy modeling}

\subsection{\ac{osier}'s planning potential}

% This chapter addresses my proposal to ``validate'' \ac{osier} by conducting a
% case study of energy planning processes in Champaign-Urbana through interviews
% with decision makers and planners about energy justice, energy modeling, and
% energy planning. As well as introduce interviewees to \ac{osier} itself and
% solicit feedback from them about its potential usefulness and what obstacles
% may interfere with its adoption. 

% Although I originally set out to conduct a limited case study of Chambana, I
% discovered that municipalities in Illinois do not, in general, have the
% decision making authority to make specific choices about their energy supply.
% Thus, I expanded my study to the state level; interviewing people from the
% \ac{ipa} and \ac{icc}. This expanded scope provided evidence for structural
% challenges blocking municipal influence from energy planning processes.
% Further, this evinces a tension among distributive, procedural, and
% recognition justice.

% \section{Progress on developing tools for local use}

% \begin{itemize} \item The literature review chapter indicated that most energy
%     modeling tools and much of the related literature focus on state- or
%     national-scale energy systems. \item The the hyper-local section
%     highlighted some studies that integrated local perspectives with energy
%     modeling. Those papers include \cite{mckenna_combining_2018,
%     johannsen_municipal_2023, fleischhacker_portfolio_2019} \item There have
%     also been studies investigating the development of models for, and use by,
%     city and urban planners. \end{itemize}


\section{Discussion}

Some ideas to consider ...

\begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a growing body of literature which recognizes that, despite
    the important role for municipalities in the energy transition, municipal
    governments may not be the best venue for energy modeling due to their lack
    of resources, expertise, and agency over their energy systems. However,
    nonprofits and grassroots organizations may benefit from energy modeling to
    aid the development of their energy visions which can then be used to lobby
    for policy changes (e.g., \ac{nest}'s interest in \ac{osier}).
\end{enumerate}

Maybe discuss some of the benefits and limitations of \ac{osier} ...

Benefits include
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \ac{osier} allows for any number of constraints, objectives, and even
    allows for user-defined objectives, a design philosophy consistent with the
    first principle from Elmallah et al. which called for ``place-based''
    solutions \cite{elmallah_frontlining_2022}. However, place-based solutions
    require authentic engagement and ``quantitative metrics cannot replace on
    the ground work that includes qualitative, community-based approaches in
    devising policy solutions'' \cite{elmallah_frontlining_2022}. While \ac{osier}
    can stand alone as an \ac{esom}, it is likely most effective as part of an 
    iterative, participatory, approach as outlined by McGookin et al. 2024 
    \cite{mcgookin_advancing_2024}.
