\section{Methodology}
\label{section:interview-methods}

This section describes the methods for selecting, conducting, and analying the
interviews. First, I describe the analytical approach. Then I discuss the method
for selecting interviews and provide an anonymized summary of the participants.
Lastly, I share a table that summarizes the themes that came out of the
interviews and which sections discuss each theme.


\subsection{Thematic Analysis}
This section describes a multiple-case study using interviews with energy
planners, decision makers, and community advocates at local and state levels.
The municipalities were chosen to exemplify maximum variation cases across the
different possible mechanisms for energy choice within Illinois shown in Figure
\ref{fig:illinois-flow-chart} \cite{flyvbjerg_five_2006}. Champaign and Urbana 
correspond to municipalities that receive electricity from \acp{iou} and 
can purchase energy through \ac{mca} or the default supply. Naperville and \ac{uiuc}
represent municipalities with independent utilities and receive electricity 
from two places. The former contracts with \ac{imea} and the latter owns and operates
its own generating resources. The interviewees were
chosen to cover a range of important energy perspectives and contexts to
create a holistic narrative about energy planning within Illinois. A
multiple-case study also enhances validity by enabling replication and
comparison \cite{johannsen_designing_2021, yin_case_2018}. Further, since one
purpose of this study is to evaluate the design and applicability of the tool,
\ac{osier}, a multiple-case study design will strengthen software changes and
feature additions, and support \ac{osier}'s use in other locations and contexts.
The raw data include interview transcriptions and the relevant municipal climate
and energy plans, if available. The interviews were transcribed with the
``listen and revise'' method using the Whisper transcription tool
\cite{battaglia_listen_2024}. This method has two steps. First, I transcribe the
interview using Whisper. Second, I listen back to the interview and revise the
transcription to correct errors. Whisper uses \ac{ai} to automate the
transcription process. Both the data and the \ac{ai} model used to transcribe
the interview audio were hosted locally (i.e., without an internet connection),
eliminating privacy concerns \cite{battaglia_listen_2024}. Figure
\ref{fig:whisper} shows a screenshot of the Whisper interface.

    the privacy of the interviewees, only ``Speaker 1'' is shown. ``Speaker 1''
    is the author of this thesis.}

\end{figure}

The transcribed interviews were initially coded using a deductive approach that
involves a predefined set of codes. These initial codes aligned with the three
aims of this study:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item identify how (if) energy models are used to support energy planning at
    local and state levels,
    \item determine the ways energy justice or equity are incorporated into
    planning decisions
    \item assess the usefulness of a new modeling tool, \ac{osier}.
\end{enumerate} 
However, I combined this with an inductive process to develop additional codes.
The benefits of this hybrid strategy are that it allows comparing and
contrasting the results of the present study with existing literature and
producing insights novel to this study. The interview coding step was also
performed locally with the \texttt{Taguette} tool \cite{rampin_taguette_2021}.
Figure \ref{fig:taguette} shows a screenshot of the \texttt{Taguette} software.

\subsection{Interview Data Collection}

This study consists of thirteen expert interviews, each lasting 60 to 90
minutes, and a document review of the communities' climate action plans. These
interviews were conducted virtually using the Zoom teleconferencing software
through the second half of 2024 and beginning of 2025, using a semi-structured
approach based on an interview guide designed according to five main topics (for
details, see Appendix \ref{chapter:interview-guide}).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Background --- learn about the interviewees' experience and background
    with energy planning in their context.
    \item Existing planning processes --- clarify the processes used to develop
    climate action plans and energy policies.
    \item Conceptions of justice or equity --- elucidate the extent to which
    justice informs energy policies and plans.
    \item Use of models in planning processes --- identify if energy models are
    used and overall perceptions of modeling.
    \item Assessment of the \ac{osier} tool --- introduce \ac{osier} through a
    short presentation and invite reactions and feedback from the interviewee.
\end{enumerate}
The interviewees were chosen through a combination of
purposive\footnote{Purposive sampling selects participants based on specific
characteristics or expertise \cite{ahmed_how_2024}.} and snowball
\footnote{Snowball sampling involves participants referring others that also
match the research criteria \cite{ahmed_how_2024}. In this case, interviewees
connected me with other energy planners in their network.} sampling to identify
staff with sufficient and relevant energy planning experience. Each interviewee
is involved in decision-making, planning, or advocacy in their respective
context. Table \ref{tab:interviewees} summarizes the interviewees for this
study. The \textit{organization} column refers to the organization that either
employs, or is represented by, the interviewee. The \textit{type} column assigns
the interviewee to a broad category including:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item practitioner --- someone involved in the process of energy planning
    and/or carries out policy directives from policymakers,
    \item advocate --- a person or organization that lobbies for policy outcomes
    on behalf of a group of stakeholders,
    \item policymaker --- someone who participates in the ultimate
    decision-making related to energy policy.
\end{enumerate}
