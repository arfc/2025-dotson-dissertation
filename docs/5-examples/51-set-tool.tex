\section{Example 1: Reanalyzing the \acs{set}}

Existing and advanced nuclear reactors will be important resources for
addressing the multi-dimensional challenge of climate change. Further, new
nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure will be necessary to support the next
generation of reactors and handling existing \ac{hlw} waste. Given the myriad
possible fuel cycle options, how should decision makers choose a fuel cycle to
pursue? The best currently available tool is the \acf{set}, which was developed
as part of the \ac{fco} in 2011 after the United States \ac{doe} commissioned a
report called ``Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening Study'' (``the
Study'')\cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014-2}. The \ac{set} and corresponding report
presented recommendations based on a metric weighting analysis facilitated by
the \ac{set} where fuel cycles were ranked from ``most promising'' to ``less
promising'' and the least promising options were given no designation. This
example extends the work done by the Study by using \ac{osier} to identify
Pareto optimal solutions and use \ac{mcda} tools to further select interesting
fuel cycle(s). The next section gives a high-level overview of the nuclear fuel
cycle. Followed by sections describing the \ac{set} and its methodology. Lastly,
new results from \ac{osier} are shared and discussed.

\subsection{Overview of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle}

The nuclear fuel cycle describes the cradle-to-grave lifecycle of nuclear
materials. The nuclear fuel cycle begins with extraction via mining or in-situ
leaching, followed by processing into usable fuel forms, then irradiation in a reactor,
and finally either disposed of or recycled \cite{tsoulfanidis_review_2013}. Figure
\ref{fig:nuclear-fuel-cycle} presents a stylized illustration the fuel cycle.
The light green boxes correspond to stages in the front of the fuel cycle, while
the beige boxes represent the back of the fuel cycle. Nuclear material generally
flows in the direction of the solid lines, except in ``closed'' fuel cycles
where irradiated material takes a detour through some reprocessing stage or
stages denoted by the dashed arrows. Several stages could be expanded into
further sub-steps --- these were omitted for simplicity. The Study and the
\ac{set} represent holistic analyses that include every stage of the fuel cycle.

  materials through the fuel cycle. Dashed lines correspond to a closed fuel
  cycle.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{\ac{set} Metrics and Methodology}

The \ac{set} is an Excel-based application containing metric data from the
Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening Study \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}
and an objective weighting calculator to help decision makers identify fuel
cycles of interest based on their priorities and preferences. The \ac{set}
evaluates representative fuel cycle options, \acp{eg}, based on a set of nine
aggregated metrics \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}. Table
\ref{tab:evaluation-metrics} lists these metrics and their sub-criteria. Some
criteria do not influence the \ac{set} results because all \acp{eg} performed
equally well. One such metric is ``material attractiveness,'' because all \acp{eg} could be
implemented with unattractive materials \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014-1}. Fuel
cycles were assigned to \acp{eg} based on shared physical principles such that
differences in implementation could be adequately captured \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}.  
Each of the criteria in Table \ref{tab:evaluation-metrics} were further simplified 
through a binning process that grouped similarly performing \acp{eg}. Figure 
\ref{fig:bin-plot} provides an example for how the Study's authors binned the data.

\subsection{Limitations of the \ac{set}}
Despite being its status as the best avaiable tool for evaluating fuel cycles in the Study, the
\ac{set} has some limitations primarily with the methods the Study used for drawing conclusions.
First, the \ac{set} does not consider Pareto optimality. Users are able to adjust the weights
for different objectives to obtain different results, but the full space of options is obfuscated
from users. Second, the Study's authors binned data on two occasions, first to generate the 
evaluation groups and a second time to make the analysis more tractable. The \ac{set} calculates
\ac{eg} performance based on these secondary bins, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bin-plot}. This
exacerbates differences among \acp{eg} in different bins and eliminates differences among \acp{eg}
in the same bin. Further challenging the comparison of the \acp{eg}. Lastly, the \ac{set} relies 
totally on expert input. This is appropriate for generating data for each \ac{eg} or even each fuel
cycle option. It is unreasonable to expect non-technical stakeholders to opine on which isotopes
should be separated, or whether a reactor should have a fast or thermal spectrum. But stakeholders
can certainly weigh-in on the tradeoffs and prioritization of different metrics in the Study. This
example with \ac{osier} addresses these gaps by using raw data from the Study to identify Pareto
optimal solutions and present them in a manner that could be used for deliberation with various
stakeholders. 

\subsection{\ac{osier} Methodology and Data}

The data for this simulation were pulled directly from the Study and its
appendices
\cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014,wigeland_nuclear_2014-2,wigeland_nuclear_2014-1}.
Table \ref{tab:metric-data} describes the data for the simulation. These data
were used to identify Pareto optimal solutions.  Importantly, \ac{osier} only
minimizes objectives, so a few metrics were adjusted from the \ac{set}. For
example, the ``compatibility'' with existing infrastructure was changed to
minimize \textit{incompatibility} with existing infrastructure. Lastly, since
decision makers are frequently interested in ``compromise'' solutions a ``high
tradeoff point'' was identified from the resulting Pareto front by calculating
the \ac{eg} that minimizes a tradeoff metric given by Equation
\ref{eqn:tradeoff} \cite{rachmawati_multiobjective_2009}. The \ac{mcda}
literature refers sometimes refers to these solutions as ``knee'' solutions
\cite{rachmawati_multiobjective_2009}.

\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:tradeoff}
    T\left(X_i, X_j\right) &= \frac{\sum_{1}^{M}\text{max}\left[0, \left(f_m\left(X_j\right) - f_m\left(X_i\right)\right]\right)}
    {\sum_{1}^{M}\text{max}\left[0, -\left(f_m\left(X_j\right) - f_m\left(X_i\right)\right)\right]},
    \intertext{where}
    X_i &= \text{the i-th solution vector}, \nonumber\\
    f_m &= \text{the m-th objective function}, \nonumber\\
    M &= \text{the total number of objectives}. \nonumber
\end{align}
\noindent
To prevent any metric from dominating the solutions, all data are normalized
with the $L_\infty$-norm. Due to the implicit assumption that all fuel cycles
and evaluation groups are mutually exclusive, the complete set of solutions in
design space is given by the identity matrix of size $40 \times 40$.

\subsection{Results}
The primary result for this example is the identification of a Pareto front for
the different \acp{eg} considered in the \ac{set}. Figure
\ref{fig:full-set-space} shows the output Pareto front.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.85\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/05_examples_chapter/full_set_plot.pgf}}
  \caption{The Pareto front for the \ac{set}.}
  \label{fig:full-set-space}
\end{figure}

The solutions are colored based on the type of recycling present in the
representative fuel cycle. Red, green, and blue solutions correspond to
once-through, limited-recycle, and continuous-recycle fuel cycles, respectively.
By inspection, the limited- and continuous-recycle \acp{eg} perform similarly on
mass of \ac{hlw} requiring disposal, activity of \ac{snf} and \ac{hlw} at
100,000 years, water use, safety challenges, and natural thorium requirements.
The \acp{eg} with recycling have a larger spread over the activity at 100 years,
land use, and disposed mass of \ac{du}. This is because these fuel cycles vary
by degree of recycling and isotope separation. The once-through fuel cycles vary
widely in performance across all objectives. There is an apparent ``lower'' density
of results in the latter five objectives: development cost, development time, \ac{foak}
cost, incompatibility, and unfamiliarity. This is because these objectives were based on
categorical variables rather than continuous ones. The low density of solutions is the
result of overlapping solutions.

% representing once-through fuel cycles.

Next, Figure \ref{fig:single-eg-set-space} identifies a tradeoff minimizing
``knee'' solution. This solution represents a once-through fuel cycle using
natural uranium fuel in fast critical reactors to very high burnup
\cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014-2}.

with institutional challenges and development costs.

Finally, Table \ref{tab:summary-data} summarizes the results from the \ac{set} and
\ac{osier} simulation. Highlighted rows indicate places where the \ac{set} and \ac{osier}
disagree while the color corresponds to the nature of the disagreement. Orange rows are
Pareto optimal solutions, as identified by \ac{osier}, that the Study did not designate as promising ---
reinterpreted here as ``not promising.'' Yellow rows are those \acp{eg} designated as ``most promising''
or ``potentially promising'' by the Study that \ac{osier} found to be sub-optimal. The solitary green row
highlights that the Study categorized EG04 as ``less promising'' while \ac{osier} identified it as the 
only ``knee'' solution which suggests a higher qualitative ranking (e.g., ``most'' or ``potentially'' promising).

\subsection{Discussion}

\ac{osier} and the Study disagree on precisely half of the \acp{eg}' categorization. Although the
Study rankings are more granular than whether a solution is Pareto optimal (a binary), its recommendations
elevated several \acp{eg} that \ac{osier} found to be sub-optimal, while dismissing several Pareto optimal
ones. Solutions on the Pareto front are all considered co-optimal, by definition. Differences emerge when 
\ac{mcda} tools are applied based on inputs and preferences from decision makers and/or stakeholders.
The most likely culprit for the disagreement between \ac{osier} and the \ac{set} is the binning process
described earlier. While the \acp{eg} are ``bins'' of fuel cycles sharing similar physical characteristics,
further binning the data into smaller sub-groups results in a loss of information. The second source of disagreement
is possibly from the dependence on expert judgement. Table \ref{tab:summary-data} evinces a bias in favor of closed
fuel cycles.

Finally, the data from the Study and the \ac{set} are static. If future studies wish to evaluate different metrics
associated with these fuel cycles or update the data based on new information, new fuel cycle simulations must be run.
The future work section, Section \ref{section:future-work}, describes how \ac{osier} could be used on conjunction
with other codes to address this issue.
