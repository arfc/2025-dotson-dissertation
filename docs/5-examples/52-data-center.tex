\section{Example 2: Powering a Data Center}

\subsection{Why data centers?}

\subsection{What technology options exist?}

\subsection{Data for the simulation}

The data for this simulation are provided by this table from Walmsley et al. 2018 \cite{walmsley_energy_2018}. This method
accounts for the time value of energy using an energy value accounting method. I also selected the \acs{eroi}$_std$ for the simulation
which accounts for the self-use of inputs by the generating technology.

\textcolor{red}{I chose monocrystalline-silicone technology for solar panels since this technology was used \ac{nrel}'s \ac{atb}.}
