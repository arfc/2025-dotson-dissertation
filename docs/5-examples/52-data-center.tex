\section{Example 2: Powering a Data Center}

Electricity demand from data centers, driven by advances in \ac{ai}, has grown
tremendously in the last two years. Utilities and grid operators predict even
more demand growth into the future
\cite{pjm_resource_adequacy_planning_department_2024_2024,miso_long-term_2024,davenport_generational_2024}.
This sudden and unexpected growth in demand adds pressure to the electricity
system, leading operators to build additional fossil fuel resources to ensure a
reliable supply of electricity \cite{howland_ethan_pjm_2025}. In turn, this
could lead to greater pressure on the climate and further exacerbate inequities
as described in Section \ref{section:climate-change-risk}. This example models a
stylized data center with several technology options and three objectives which
stakeholders, including data center owners, community members, and policy
makers, may find themselves weighing when deciding which technology options to
pursue to power these new loads. Table \ref{tab:dc-params} lists the parameters
used to run the \texttt{CapacityExpansion} problem.

\subsection{Demand Data}
The electricity demand for this example was modeled after a stylized
``high-availability'' gigawatt-scale data center. For simplicity, this example
considers ``high-availability'' equivalent to a constant power draw. In
practice, data centers can experience large, rapid, fluctuations in power
consumption \cite{quint_practical_2025}. A gigawatt-scale data center is
reasonable given recent announcements for a two gigawatt data center in
Louisiana \cite{swinhoe_meta_2024} and multiple \acp{ppa} with existing and
previously retired nuclear reactors, each capable of producing around a gigawatt
of electric power
\cite{shaw_microsoft_2024,constellation_energy_constellation_2025}.

\subsection{Technology Options}
There are myriad technology options available to power a data center. For
simplicity, these choices were restricted to 
\begin{itemize}
    \item natural gas,
    \item ``advanced'' natural gas with \ac{ccs},
    \item ``large'' nuclear (e.g., an AP1000),
    \item advanced nuclear (e.g., an \ac{sfr}),
    \item solar panels (monocrystalline-silicone for consistency with
    \ac{nrel}'s \ac{atb}),
    \item 4-hour battery storage (lithium-ion).
\end{itemize}

\noindent
These technologies were chosen for their potential to be co-located with a data
center. There is a miniscule potential for new hydropower in the United States
\cite{lopez_us_2012}, geothermal requires geological activity that is similarly
hard to find \cite{lopez_us_2012}, and wind energy requires a vast amount of
land. Table \ref{tab:dc-tech-options} summarizes the data for the different
technology options. The table was generated automatically using \ac{osier}'s
built-in \texttt{technology\_dataframe} method. 
\begin{table}[htpb!]

    \caption{Summary of technology data used in the data center example.}
    \label{tab:dc-tech-options}
    \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\input{tables/datacenter_tech_options_annotated.tex}}
\end{table}
\noindent
Note that the ``cost'' variables all have units of ``millions of dollars'' (M\$)
in the numerator. \ac{eroi} is a unitless quantity. The \ac{eroi} data come from
Walmsley et al. 2018 \cite{walmsley_energy_2018}.
 
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Objectives}
This example optimizes three objectives: total system cost (M\$), total carbon
emissions (megatonnes), and \ac{eroi}. \ac{eroi} is defined by Equation
\ref{eqn:eroi-std} \cite{walmsley_energy_2018}.

\begin{align}
    EROI_{std} &= \frac{\dot E_{net}}{\dot E_{\text{om}} + \dot E_{\text{con}} + \dot E_{\text{dec}} + \dot E_{\text{is}} + \dot E_{\text{os}}},
    \label{eqn:eroi-std}
    \intertext{where}
    \dot E &= \text{energy flow} \quad \left[\frac{\text{Gj}}{\text{y}}\right]\nonumber,\\
    \text{net} &= \text{net generation},\nonumber\\
    \text{om} &= \text{operation and management},\nonumber\\
    \text{con} &= \text{construction},\nonumber\\
    \text{dec} &= \text{deconstruction},\nonumber\\
    \text{is} &= \text{inflow self-use},\nonumber\\
    \text{os} &= \text{outflow self-use}.\nonumber
\end{align}
\noindent
Typically, \ac{eroi} should be maximized. However, \ac{osier} only minimizes
objectives, so this example minimizes the inverse capacity-weighted \ac{eroi} as
shown by Equation \ref{eqn:eroi-obj}.

\begin{align}
    \textbf{Minimize}\left(\sum^{G}\frac{\textbf{CAP}_g}{EROI_{std}^g}\right)
    \label{eqn:eroi-obj}
\end{align}
Capacity must be in the numerator otherwise the objective creates a perverse
incentive where the objective can be minimized by simply increasing the capacity
of certain technologies. This way, the model will prefer less capacity,
\textit{ceteris paribus}, and prefer technologies with higher \ac{eroi}.
Additionally, including capacity in the objective allows the model to
distinguish among different portfolios. 

\subsection{Synthetic Solar Data}

The solar availability curve was generated by combining a sinusoidal curve with
some random noise and then forcing negative values to zero. Including noise
simulates natural fluctuations in solar generation caused by passing clouds or
other light blocking occurrences. The formula to generate these data is given by
Equation \ref{eqn:synthetic-solar}.

\begin{align}
    S(t) &= \textbf{max}\left(0, - \sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{N} + \phi\right) + \chi\right)
    \label{eqn:synthetic-solar}
    \intertext{where}
    S &= \text{solar availability} \quad \left[-\right], \nonumber\\
    t &= \text{time} \quad \left[\text{hours}\right],\nonumber\\
    N &= \text{the total number of hours,}\nonumber\\
    \phi &= \text{a phase shift of $\frac{\pi}{2}$,}\nonumber\\
    \chi &= \text{a normally distributed random variable} \in [0, 0.15] \nonumber
\end{align}
\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:synthetic-solar} illustrates the synthetic solar data.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

    \resizebox{0.65\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/05_examples_chapter/synthetic_solar_plot.pgf}}
    \caption{Synthetic solar data for a period of a week.}
    \label{fig:synthetic-solar}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

The capacity factor for a generator may be calculated by

\begin{align}
  CF &= \frac{E_{tot}}{P_{np}*N}
  \intertext{where}
  E_{tot} &= \text{the total energy produced in given period, $\left[MWh\right]$} \nonumber\\
  P_{np} &= \text{the nameplate capacity of a generator, $\left[MW\right]$}\nonumber,\\
  N &= \text{the number of hours in a given period.}\nonumber
\end{align}

\noindent Since these data are normalized, capacity factor reduces to
\begin{align}
    CF &= \frac{\sum_t^{N}{S(t)}}{N}
    \intertext{where}
    S &= \text{solar availability} \quad \left[-\right].\nonumber
\end{align}

The capacity factor for the solar availability data presented here comes out to
just under 0.25, which is slightly higher than, but consistent with, the published national average
capacity factors from the \acf{eia} for solar panels in the United States
\cite{energy_information_administration_capacity_2020}.

\subsection{Convergence}
This example used a ``maximum generation'' termination criterion. To verify that
the problem is reasonably converged after 200 generations, I plotted the
performance of each generation with the hypervolume indicator
\cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. The hypervolume indicator is useful when the
Pareto front is unknown and cannot be approximated. Instead of calculating the
deviation between the simulation results and a known Pareto front to establish
convergence (where a smaller deviation is better), hypervolume calculates the
distance between the results and some reference point (where a greater distance
is preferred). A nadir point (i.e., the worst performing solution) is a common
choice for reference point and was the point chosen, here. Figure
\ref{fig:convergence} shows that the simulation converged quite quickly and
likely ran longer than necessary.

    \resizebox{0.75\columnwidth}{!}{\input{figures/05_examples_chapter/dc_convergence_plot.pgf}}
    \caption{Convergence of the data center simulation with a hypervolume indicator.}
    \label{fig:convergence}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}

Figure \ref{fig:dc_objective_space} shows the Pareto front for this example. The
extreme solutions for each objective are highlighted. There appears to be a
tradeoff between cost and carbon emissions that is consistent with the earlier
demonstration problem in Section \ref{section:four-obj-results}.
\textcolor{black}{This tradeoff is evinced by intersecting diagonals between the
cost and emissions axes. Some of the middling solutions have a tradeoff that is
less pronounced but every solution that performs well on total cost performs
less well on carbon emissions and vice versa.} Carbon emissions and \ac{eroi} do
not demonstrate a persistent tradeoff. The least cost solution (in red) performs
the worst on carbon emissions but among the best on \ac{eroi}. Whereas the
solution with the least emissions (green) is also the solution with the best
\ac{eroi} (purple) and the most expensive. Despite this, Figure
\ref{fig:dc_objective_space} shows tight groups of similarly performing
solutions on carbon emisisons that fan out on the \ac{eroi} axis. This pattern
is also true of the \ac{eroi} objective. These patterns suggest that there are
solutions which perform well on \ac{eroi} and cost, or \ac{eroi} and emissions,
but no solutions which perform well on all three objectives.

%     \label{fig:dc_objective_space_10} \end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:dc_design_space} shows the design space for the data center
problem with the corresponding extreme solutions highlighted. Since the energy
demand for this example was conveniently chosen to be 1 GW, the axis values for
all technologies are in units of gigawatts. The least cost solution went all-in
on conventional natural gas with no emissions abatement. While the least
emissions and best \ac{eroi} solution went all-in on conventional and advanced
nuclear. The only technology that almost totally excluded by the model was
battery storage. This is likely because battery storage is intended to shift
load throughout the day and is typically most useful in solutions with high
penetrations of \ac{vre}. However, the model was allowed to build natural gas.
So, rather than shifting the load with batteries, the solutions with large
amounts of solar panels prefer some form of natural gas capacity when cost is
prioritized and will prefer some form of nuclear energy when emissions are
prioritized.

\subsection{Discussion}

% First, this model is stylized and the results should not be used to inform
% business decisions.
Despite their uniformly lower costs reported in Table \ref{tab:dc-tech-options},
solar panels and battery storage played a diminiutive role in the results and
did not seem to play a role in the least cost solutions. Of course, solar panels
are at a serious disadvantage because they are not dispatchable and have
relatively low capacity factors. The solar data used in this model, shown in
Figure \ref{fig:synthetic-solar}, has a capacity factor a little less than 0.25
for modeled period. This means that in order to produce the enough total energy,
solar panel capacity must be 400\% of the data center's rated power draw. 
But, due to the intermittent and diurnal nature of solar generation, this capacity
must be paired with at least enough battery capacity to match the power draw from a 
data center and with sufficient storage duration to shift the generation to match 
the actual demand profile of the data center. Indeed the
design space results in Figure \ref{fig:dc_design_space} show that solar
capacity barely exceeds 140\% indicating that solar panels are not a preferred
primary energy source.


The results indicate that data center owners and operators would prefer to power
data centers with natural gas. Especially since the free market does not price
in externalities such as carbon emissions and there are no national prices on
carbon. The results also show that, when emissions are weighed more heavily than
costs, nuclear energy is an appealing alternative to natural gas. These
conclusions are consistent with the current pattern of companies installing more
natural gas plants and entering \acp{ppa} with nuclear generating factilities
\cite{wittenberg_how_2025,swinhoe_meta_2024,constellation_energy_constellation_2025,
shaw_microsoft_2024}.
