\section{\acs{mga} with \acl{moo}}
\label{section:mga-moo}

\ac{osier} addresses structural uncertainty in two ways. First, it uses 
\ac{moo} to identify tradeoffs. Second, since structural uncertainty will
persist regardless of the number of modeled objectives, \ac{osier} offers
a high-dimensional version of the classic \ac{mga} approach to handling
structural uncertainty.
This thesis applies some ideas from \ac{mga} to the analysis of the sub-optimal
space from a \acl{moo} problem. Due to their iterative process, \acp{ga}
naturally generate many samples in a problem's feasible space. However, this
does not lead to a ``limited set'' of solutions but rather a potentially
unbounded set. Some literature developed \acp{ga} that directly use \ac{mga} in
the iterative process
\cite{zechman_evolutionary_2004,zechman_evolutionary_2013}. However, existing
Python libraries such as \ac{pymoo} and \ac{deap} do not implement these
methods, and the challenge is not an inability to sample the sub-optimal space,
but rather to provide a comprehensible subset of solutions. The algorithm I
developed in this thesis to search the near-feasible space is the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions \textit{using any \ac{ga}}.
    \item Decide on a slack value (e.g., 10\% or 0.1), which represents an
    acceptable deviation from the Pareto front.
    \item Create a ``near-feasible front'' where the coordinates of each point
    are multiplied by unity plus the slack value. This is equivalent to relaxing
    the objective functions and converting them to a constraint. 
    \item Every individual is checked if all of its coordinates are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item below all of the coordinates for at least one point on the
        near-feasible front and
        \item above all of the coordinates for at least one point on the Pareto
        front.
    \end{itemize}  
    \item Lastly, the set of interior points may be sampled either randomly or
    with a farthest-first-traversal algorithm to restrict the number of analyzed
    solutions.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:nd-mga} and Figure \ref{fig:3d-mga} show ``near-feasible
fronts'' and interior points with 20 percent slack for a 2-D and 3-D Pareto
front, respectively. Figure \ref{fig:nd-mga} shows clearly that only points
within the near-optimal space (gray) are considered. Illustrating this behavior
in three dimensions (and above) is considerably more difficult. The 3-D interior
points should be covered by both surfaces, obstructing their view. Figure
\ref{fig:3d-mga} shows that this is the case in three panels. First, a top view
of an opaque Pareto front (green) where no interior points can be observed.
Second, the same view with a translucent Pareto front, revealing interior points
and the near-optimal front (blue). Finally, the view from underneath the
near-optimal front once again obscures the interior points, except for two near
the edges of the sub-optimal space. The tested points are omitted for clarity.

\subsection{Farthest First Traversal}
Previous studies emphasized that a key benefit of \ac{mga} is
obtaining a set of near-optimal solutions that are maximally different in design
space \cite{decarolis_modelling_2016, yue_review_2018-1}. Instead of
constraining a linear program to guarantee a maximally-different solution set.
\ac{osier} implements a ``greedy'' search algorithm in decision space to find
solutions \cite{hochbaum_best_1985}. The algorithm is
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Calculate a distance matrix $\mathcal{D}$ containing the distances among
  all points. 
  \item Choose an initial point (either randomly or a specified point).
  \item Step towards the point that has the maximum distance from the current
  point that has not already been visited.
  \item Continue until the desired number of points has been reached.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:mga-fft} demonstrates \ac{mga} with
``farthest-first-traversal.'' The left plot in Figure \ref{fig:mga-fft} shows
the objective space for the same problem as in Figure \ref{fig:nd-mga}. The plot
on the right shows the corresponding design space. Both plots show the Pareto
front as red dots. The colored dots represent the points selected by the ``farthest-first-traversal''
algorithm. These points are connected by similarly colored arrows in the design space plot. The arrow
color corresponds to the color of the next selected point (i.e., the next farthest point).
