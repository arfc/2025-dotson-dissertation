\section{Limitations of \ac{osier}}

This section describes some of the limitations in \ac{osier}'s modeling details
and scope. For example, \ac{osier} does not model interactions between the
environment and the energy system. It also does not include a way to model the
effect of carbon emissions and/or any kind of climate forcing from heat-trapping
emissions nor any kind of geoengineering measures.

This responds to some of Cliff's comments on \ac{osier}.
