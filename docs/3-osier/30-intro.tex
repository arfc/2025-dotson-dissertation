This chapter introduces the \acf{osier}, a novel open-source energy system modeling
framework for \acl{moo} \cite{dotson_osier_2024}. There are currently no
\acp{esom} that enable \ac{moo} and \ac{osier} fills that gap. Figure 
\ref{fig:osier_flow} illustrates the flow of data into and within \ac{osier}.

Technology data, objectives, constraints, and a dispatch model are all features
within \ac{osier}, while \ac{pymoo} drives the optimization of these objectives \cite{blank_pymoo_2020}.
The dispatch model is independently executable for inspecting specific test
cases and mapping solutions from other solvers onto \ac{osier}'s objective
space. The next sections elaborate on model inputs, \acfp{ga}, and the dispatch model's 
formulation.
