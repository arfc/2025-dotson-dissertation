    \begin{block}{Arrow's Impossibility Theorem}
        It is impossible to construct a utility function
        that maps individual preferences onto a global preference
        order without imposition or dictating \cite{arrow_difficulty_1950,franssen_arrows_2005}.

    \begin{block}{Consequences of Arrow's Theorem}
        \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
            \item There is no one-size-fits-all method for public engagement or
            decision-making.
            \item Aggregated metrics can never adequately capture ``just outcomes'' ---
            this would imply a utility function.
            \item Participatory processes must include a deliberative element to evaluate
            tradeoffs.
        \end{enumerate}
