    \frametitle{The Clean Energy Transition}
    Our changing climate and additional demand drivers from data 
    centers and \gls{ai} require a just transition from fossil 
    fuels to clean energy.

    \frametitle{\glspl{esom}}
    \Glspl{esom} are a class of tools designed to 
    optimize this transition. (Provide examples?)

    They will become more important with more \gls{vre}
    and more volatile weather.

    \textit{But they have at least two big flaws}.

    \frametitle{Flaws with \glspl{esom}}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item All current \glspl{esom} optimize a single objective --- cost.
        \item \glspl{esom} struggle to model the ``human dimension'' thereby
        limiting their ability to address justice.

    \end{enumerate}
    Here, justice refers to the intersection of three core aspects:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Distributional justice --- how benefits and burdens are (not) shared.
        \item Procedural justice --- relates to the ways decisions are made and who participates.
        \item Recognition justice --- 
    \end{enumerate}
